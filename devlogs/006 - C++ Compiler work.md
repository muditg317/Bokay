## Goals
- [ ] Create structure for the various stages of compilation in C++ engine

## Struggles
- Nothing serious today!

## Notes
### No major stuff

## Log
- Add validation to input/output paths for compilation
- Begin work on parsing for the input file

## TODO
1. Start designing my language

## Language Status/Changes
- None today!

## Unorganized thoughts as they came
- Boost::algorithm is a header-only library, so it has no "component" for find_package
  - Instead of linking to Boost::algorithm, must use Boost::headers
