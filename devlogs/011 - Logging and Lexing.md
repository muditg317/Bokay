## Goals
- [x] Bug-test and semi-finalize lexer
- [ ] Add logging lib

## Struggles
- Nothing serious today!

## Notes
### No major stuff

## Log
- Add regex to capture entire comments as single tokens
- Provide line and col numbers to token objects

## TODO
1. ---

## Language Status/Changes
- None today!

## Unorganized thoughts as they came
- Lexing out the comments seems much easier and would make the parser much simpler (simply throw out comments)
