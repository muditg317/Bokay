## Goals
- [x] Add tests for import/export syntax

## Struggles
- None serious today!

## Notes
### No major stuff

## Log
- Create test for import/export syntax
  - Only testing import currently, export not yet implemented
- Add abstract base class for compiler stages to adhere to (not sure this is beneficial but maybe it'll help with code consistency)

## TODO
- None today!

## Language Status/Changes
- None today!

## Unorganized thoughts as they came
- None today!
