# 🅱️okay

This is a language that I decided (on 11/10/21) to create just for fun. I was inspired by some progress videos on the development of [Porth](https://gitlab.com/tsoding/porth).

The name is just funny because I love saying 🅱️okay.

**Note: This language is WIP and is by no means intended for large scale use**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haha who knows though, maybe it'll blow up :)
